# Predict Stock Price With News Headlines
A project of my text mining course. 
## Purpose 
This project is working to use text mining and time series to detect the connection between the news and the movement of the stock market. Two tasks are included in this project: one is to find out the way of news affecting the stock price rise and fall by machine learning and deep learning; the other is to create a time series forecasting model to predict the stock price in the next 100 days
